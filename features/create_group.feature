Feature: Creating a group
  Background:
    Given I am logged in as mislav
      And I am currently in the project ruby_rockstars
  
  Scenario: Mislav sees there are no groups yet
    When I go to the groups page
    Then I should see "Create a group"

  Scenario: Mislav creates his group and invites a person
    When I go to the groups page
      And I follow "Create a group"
    Then I should see "Create group"

    When I fill in the following:
      | group_name        | MislavCorp                                                              |
      | group_permalink   | mislavcorp                                                              |
     And I press "Create"
     Then I should see "MislavCorp"
      And I should see "Invite people to the group"
      And I should see "Add a project"
      And I should see "Mislav MarohniÄ‡"

    When I fill in "Username or email" with "pablo@teambox.com"
      And I press "Invite"
    # Using format.html which redirects, not .js
    Then "pablo@teambox.com" should receive 1 email
     And I should see "An email was sent to this user, but they still haven't confirmed."

    When I follow "Add a project"
      When I select "Ruby Rockstars" from "group[project_ids][]"
      Then I should see "Ruby Rockstars"
